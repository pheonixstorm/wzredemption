	MPLAYER DIRECTPLAY EXTRAS

	This library provides extra extensions for 	DirectPlay games that that
	run on the Mplayer network. 
  
	Current Features
	----------------

	Lobby Status Reporting	-	Allows games to report staus information
								to the game's Mplayer lobby. This inform-
								ation includes items such as changing the
								name of the game room, reporting game-in
								progress details, etc.

	Score Reporting			-	Allows games to report game statistics
								and scores to be saved in a database which
								can then be queried to generate rankings,
								ratings, and high score lists.

	Release Notes
	----------------

	1)	A new feature for DirectPlay in the DirectX 5.0 release is the ability
		an applications process to create multiple DirectPlay objects. The
		MPDPXTRA library will not work with applications that create more than
		one DirectPlay object. The MPDPXTRA library is compatibles with all
		pre-DirectX	5.0 applications as well as	DirectX 5.0 applications that
		create only one DirectPlay object.

	Using the Mplayer DirectPlay Extras Library
	-------------------------------------------

	1)	The Mplayer DirectPlay Extras Library consists of the following files:

		-	Header files including this one (MPDPXTRA.H) located in the Mplayer
		-	DirectPlay SDK include directory
		-	A dynamic library stub loader file (MPDPXTRA.C) that is linked with
			your application
		-	The library file (DPMPLAY.DLL) which exists in the Mplayer run-time
			system directory.

	2)	To use the library, make sure the Mplayer DirectPlay SDK include directory
		can be found in your compiler's path. Link the stub loader file, MPDPXTRA.C,
		with your application. This file is used to dynamically load DPMPLAY.DLL
		at run-time rather than statically linking it to your application. This
		allows you to ship your game without including DPMPLAY.DLL.	Instead,
		DPMPLAY.DLL will be installed and and automatically upgraded and maintained
		by Mplayer when users logon to the Mplayer network.

	3)	At run-time, your application calls MPDPXTRA_Init() to initialize the library.
		This function will attempt to locate and load DPMPLAY.DLL. The function may
		fail if your application is not being run over the Mplayer network because the
		loader does not know where DPMPLAY.DLL is located. When your application is
		launched on the Mplayer network, however, the loader will properly locate it
		in the Mplayer System Directory and load it. You may decide to gracefully
		accept a failed load of DPMPLAY.DLL. Subsequent calls to other functions in
		the library will simply not do anything. When your game is running on the
		Mplayer network, you still have the option of ignoring a failed	load although
		this should never happen. If the load does fail, the library will not actual
		perform any of its functions but players can still play your game. The game
		will not be able to change the appearance of the lobby or successfully report
		scores.

	4)	All MPDPXTRA library routines with the exception of MPDPXTRA_Init() should
		be called only after an application has successfully connected to a game
		session using the DirectPlay Open function. Calling library routines prior
		to successfully connecting to a game session will return an error code of
		MPDPXTRAERR_NOT_CONNECTED_TO_MPLAYER_NETWORK.

	Using the Lobby Status Reporting Features
	-----------------------------------------

	1)	Lobby Status Reporting allows your game to report staus information to the
		game's Mplayer lobby. There are 3 types of status that can be reported:

		- MP_LOBBYDATA_COMMENT
		- MP_LOBBYDATA_SHORT_STATUS
		- MP_LOBBYDATA_LONG_STATUS

		All status reporting to the lobby should be as infrequent as possible to
		prevent unneccessary bandwidth usage on the Mplayer network. You should never
		try to perform real-time status reporting. packets should be kept as small
		as possible.

	2) MP_LOBBYDATA_COMMENT

		This type of status reporting allows a game to change the comment underneath
		the room icon in the Mplayer lobby for this particular game session. See the
		description of the MPDPXTRA_PostLobbyData function for details.

	3) MP_LOBBYDATA_SHORT_STATUS

		These are small opaque blocks of data that can be sent to your game extension
		DLL. These data blocks will be sent to *EVERYONE* connected to your game's
		Mplayer lobby so it is imperative that they be kept extremely small. These
		types of data blocks can be used to send small pieces of information such
		as the score of the game. Your game extension DLL will be able to receive
		these data blocks and adjust the appearance of game's Mplayer lobby as well
		as the screen area inside the game room owned by the game extension DLL based
		on the contents.

	4) MP_LOBBYDATA_LONG_STATUS

		These data blocks are also opaque blocks of data that can be sent to your game
		extension DLL. They are only sent to users who have either selected this game
		session's icon in the game's Mplayer lobby or who are in the game session's
		room. Since these data blocks are sent to fewer people, they can be a bit
		larger than MP_LOBBYDATA_SHORT_STATUS data blocks to allow for more detailed
		status of a game. Once again, however, these data blocks should be kept as
		small as possible and be sent as infrequently as possible. These data blocks
		can be used to send expanded status to users interested in this particular
		game session. Your game extension DLL will be able to receive these data
		blocks and adjust the appearance of game's Mplayer lobby as well as the screen
		area inside the game room owned by the game extension DLL based	on the
		contents.
		
	Using Score Reporting Features
	------------------------------

	1)	Using the Score Rreporting features is very simple. Currently, Score
		Reporting consists of just two functions: MPDPXTRA_AddScoreResult and
		MPDPXTRA_SaveScoreResults.
		
	2)	MPDPXTRA_AddScoreResult allows you to accumulate scores on the local client
		based on four pieces of information: a source player, a destination player,
		a key, and a value. Multiple score results can be queued on the local client.
		Results that match all four parameters with a previous call	to
		MPDPXTRA_AddScoreResult will replace that result.
		
	3)	MPDPXTRA_SaveScoreResults sends all of the accumulated results to the Mplayer
		network where they are stored in a persistent database and saved for future
		score ranking and rating display. Mplayer will work with developers to
		generate algorithms that can process these results and display them accord-
		ingly.

/****** MPDPXTRA FUNCTION PROTOTYPES ******/

/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	MPDPXTRA_Init

	Initializes the Mplayer DirectPlay Extras Library. This function must be called
	before using any of the other functions available in the library. If called,
	multiple time within a single process, the library will only be loaded once and
	a reference count will be incremented for each call after the first. Each call
	to MPDPXTRA_Init must have a matching call to MPDPXTRA_Destroy which decrements
	the reference count. The library will be unloaded when the refence count reaches
	zero.

	The general purpose of this API is to allow a running game instance to report
	significant events to the lobby, for the general edification and entertainment
	of people outside the game.

	The actual objects sent should be small, and infrequent.

	Valid LobbyData objects ID's are:

	MPDPXTRA_PostServerGameData

	Posts an opaque data block up to 256K bytes in size to the game server

	The data can be retrieved from the server either synchronously via the blocking
	function MPDPXTRA_FetchSharedGameData or asynchronously using the non-blocking

	Note that this post function is non-blocking.

	Inputs:

		key -			Key value for the opaque data block between 0 and 0x7FFFFFFF.
						This key is game specific so developers are free to choose any
						key they wish.
		pData -			A pointer to opaque data block to be saved on the game server.

	MPDPXTRA_FetchServerGameData

	Fetches an opaque data block up to 256K bytes in size from the game server
	in a synchronous, blocking manner (i.e. the function won't return until
	the complete block has been received or an error has occurred).

	This function should really only be used for VERY small blocks (< 4K or so)
	of data where the user won't be aware that data transfer is occurring. The
	reason for this is that the game's user interface might block waiting for this
	call. For large blocks, it is recommended that developers use the
	MPDPXTRA_SubscribeServerGameData function.

	In order to get the size of the server game data block, 0 can be specified for
	for the dataLen. The function will return an error of
	MPDPXTRAERR_SERVER_GAME_DATA_SIZE_TOO_SMALL but the dataLen will be set to the
	correct size. A buffer can then be allocated and the function can be called again
	with the buffer passed as the pData variable.

	Inputs:

		key -			Key value for the opaque data block between 0 and 0x7FFFFFFF.
						This key is game specific so developers are free to choose any
						key they wish.
		pData -			A pointer to a buffer to be filled with the opaque server game

	MPDPXTRA_SubscribeServerGameData

	Subscribes to receive updates of game data blocks stored on the game server.
	Updates will be received in an asynchronous fashion with the passed in
	callback function getting called when a complete update has been received.

	The first time this function is called, the server will be checked for the
	specified key. If there is an opqaue data block associated with the specified
	key stored on the server, an asynchronous transfer will begin and the callback
	function will be called when the complete block as been received. Subsequent
	updates to the opaque data block on the server via the MPDPXTRA_PostServerGameData
	function will cause the subscribed block to be asynchronously transmitted to
	all current subscribers with the callback function getting called when the
	complete block has been received by the subscriber.

	It is possible to subscribe to a data block with the same key but with different
	callback functions and different contexts. Each unique pair of callback function
	pointer and context will be treated a a separate "subscriber."
